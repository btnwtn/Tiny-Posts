Tiny-Poster is a simple application that allows a user to register an account and post things to the front page.
I wrote this app as an introduction to rails. It uses the Zurb Foundation framework for the front-end.
I decided to forgo the use of Devise for user authentication in order to gain a better understanding of how sessions work in the Rails framework.
The application is half-complete, but I feel it's better to push a live version and work on other projects in order to continue my education.

You can check out the live application on [Heroku](http://vast-fjord-7234.herokuapp.com/)
